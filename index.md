Hello! I'm Victor (he/him) and I like building things with awesome humans that help more humans be awesome. Throughout my career, I've worked in many verticals - from consulting to agriculture and health - and many horizons - from Fortune 500 companies to failed startups. I've enjoyed working on challenging, vaguely-defined problems with other friendly and fearless peers from diverse backgrounds. I obtained my BS in computer engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2015 and a MS in computer science a year later focusing on machine learning. I've worked on machine learning problems in NLP, computer vision, and recommendations. I've also helped build out the platform, infrastructure, and tooling needed to bring models to customers and users. I was born in Brazil and have lived in 6 US states spanning from California to New York. Throughout this journey Iâ€™ve learned to embrace change, be persistent, and keep an open mind to others. I've also picked up several hobbies along the way including soccer, surfing, snowboarding, and a couple musical instruments. Feel free to connect on any of the sites below!
