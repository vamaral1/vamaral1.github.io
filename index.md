Hello! I'm Victor (he/him) and I work on machine learning problems. Throughout my career, I've worked in many technology verticals - from consulting to agriculture and health - and many horizons - from Fortune 500 companies to failed startups. I've enjoyed scoping out challenging, vaguely-defined problems and delivering solutions with other peers from diverse backgrounds who are also great communicators, team players, and dependable. I obtained my BS in computer engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2015 and a MS in computer science a year later focusing on machine learning. I've worked on ML problems in NLP, computer vision, and recommendations. I've also helped build out the platform, infrastructure, and tooling needed to bring  models to users. I was born in Brazil and have lived in 6 US states spanning from California to New York. Throughout this journey Iâ€™ve learned to embrace change, be persistent, and keep an open mind to others. Outside of work I mostly spend my time making music or surfing. Feel free to connect on any of the sites below!
